## 1. Tech Stack Choice

### What we used and why

| Layer | Choice | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| **Backend Framework** | NestJS (TypeScript) | Structured, opinionated — forces clean module/service/controller separation out of the box. Built-in `ValidationPipe` + `class-validator` makes DTO validation trivial |
| **Frontend Framework** | Next.js 16 (App Router) | React with file-based routing, server/client component model, and first-class TypeScript support. Better DX than raw CRA/Vite for a dashboard |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first — no context switching between CSS files. Responsive layout via breakpoint prefixes (`sm:`, `lg:`) is fast to write |
| **Charts** | Recharts | Lightweight, React-native chart library. No heavy D3 setup needed for this scope |
| **Validation** | class-validator + class-transformer | Pairs perfectly with NestJS `ValidationPipe`. Declarative decorators on DTOs — no manual if/else validation |
| **HTTP Client** | Native `fetch` (wrapped in `lib/api.ts`) | No extra dependency. `AbortController` for timeout. Keeps bundle lean |
| **Storage** | In-memory array + `onModuleInit` seed | Meets the requirement, zero config, instant restart. No Docker/DB setup friction |
| **Type Sharing** | Manual `lib/types.ts` in frontend | Single source of truth for `AnalyticsEntry`, `SummaryResponse`, `FilterParams` — keeps frontend and backend contract explicit |

### Alternatives considered

| What | Alternative | Why rejected |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Backend | Express.js | Less structure for a multi-endpoint API. Would need to wire validation manually |
| Frontend | Vite + React SPA | No SSR benefit here, but Next.js App Router is the current standard — better long-term |
| Styling | CSS Modules / Styled Components | More verbose for responsive layout. Tailwind is faster for dashboard UIs |
| Charts | Chart.js | Requires canvas refs and imperative API — less idiomatic in React |
| HTTP Client | Axios | Adds ~15KB for no meaningful benefit over `fetch` at this scale |
| Storage | JSON file on disk | More persistent but adds `fs` complexity and race conditions on concurrent writes |

## 2. AI Tool Usage

### Tools used
- **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code) — inline completions, refactoring suggestions
- **Copilot Chat / Claude Sonnet 4.6/ OpenSpec-@FissionAI** — architecture planning, prompt-driven scaffolding via `/opsx:propose` and `/opsx:apply` commands

---

### 5–10 Real Prompts Used (with context)

#### Prompt 1 — Initial scaffold
> *Context: Starting the project from scratch*
```
/opsx:propose Backend API (NestJS):
- REST API with at least 3 endpoints: GET /analytics, POST /analytics, GET /analytics/summary
- Use in-memory storage
- Basic validation and error handling
```
**Result:** Generated `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `specs/`, and `tasks.md` under `openspec/changes/backend-analytics-api/` — full spec before writing a single line of code.

---

#### Prompt 2 — NestJS controller generation
> *Context: Implementing the analytics controller*
```
Generate a NestJS controller for analytics with GET /analytics (with query filters),
POST /analytics (returns 201), and GET /analytics/summary.
GET /analytics/summary must be declared BEFORE any /:id route to avoid route conflicts.
```
**Result:** Clean controller with correct route ordering, `@Query()` + `@Body()` decorators, and `@HttpCode(HttpStatus.CREATED)`.

---

#### Prompt 3 — In-memory seed data
> *Context: Needed realistic test data for the dashboard*
```
Implement onModuleInit() in AnalyticsService to seed at least 10 realistic entries
with varied gameId (3 games), eventType (level_complete, session_start, session_end, purchase),
playerId, score, duration, and timestamp spread over the last 30 days.
```
**Result:** 12 seeded entries with natural variation — immediately made the dashboard look realistic on first load.

---

#### Prompt 4 — Frontend spec
> *Context: Planning the Next.js dashboard*
```
/opsx:propose Frontend Dashboard (Next.js):
- Display analytics data in a table or card view
- Show summary statistics (total, average, etc.)
- Form to add new entry (submit to API)
- Basic filtering or search functionality
- Responsive layout
```
**Result:** Generated 5 component specs (`SummaryStats`, `AnalyticsTable`, `FilterBar`, `AddEntryForm`, `ChartSection`) with scenario-level requirements.

---

#### Prompt 5 — Custom hooks
> *Context: Wiring frontend data fetching*
```
Create useAnalytics(filters: FilterParams) hook that calls fetchAnalytics(filters),
returns { data, total, loading, error, refresh }, re-fetches when filters change,
and is React StrictMode safe (no double-fetch side effects).
```
**Result:** Hook using `useEffect` with primitive filter values in dependency array — prevented stale closure bugs.

---

#### Prompt 6 — Integration spec
> *Context: Connecting frontend to backend*
```
/opsx:propose Integration:
- Frontend calls backend API
- Handle loading/error states properly
- Data flows correctly between frontend and backend
```
**Result:** Identified 5 integration gaps not covered by individual specs — most importantly, isolated error states per component so a summary failure doesn't crash the table.

---

#### Prompt 7 — CORS fix
> *Context: Browser showing CORS error on POST /analytics*
```
Fix CORS in NestJS main.ts — POST /analytics preflight OPTIONS request is failing.
Current config: app.enableCors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000' }).
Add methods, credentials, and allowedHeaders.
```
**Result:** Added `methods: 'GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS'`, `credentials: true`, `allowedHeaders: 'Content-Type,Authorization'`.

---

#### Prompt 8 — Error boundary component
> *Context: Needed isolated error handling per section*
```
Create a React ErrorBoundary class component that catches render errors,
shows a fallback UI with the error message and a "Try again" button,
and resets on button click.
```
**Result:** `ErrorBoundary.tsx` with `componentDidCatch`, `getDerivedStateFromError`, and a reset mechanism.

---

#### Prompt 9 — README generation
> *Context: Writing project documentation*
```
Write README.md with: prerequisites (Node version), how to run backend, how to run frontend,
API endpoints documentation with request/response examples for all 3 endpoints,
project structure tree, and tech stack table.
```
**Result:** Complete README in one pass — zero manual editing needed.

---

#### Prompt 10 — PM task review
> *Context: Before handing tasks to engineers*
```
Review both backend and frontend task lists against the original requirements.
Check for gaps, conflicts, ordering issues, and risks.
Give APPROVED / APPROVED WITH NOTES / NEEDS REVISION verdict.
Produce handover messages for each engineer session.
```
**Result:** PM caught a missing task — `GET /analytics/summary` route ordering was not explicitly flagged as a risk. Added task 5.2 note before implementation.

### What worked well with AI assistance
- **Spec-first development** — generating specs before code forced clarity on requirements early
- **Boilerplate elimination** — DTOs, interfaces, module wiring took seconds instead of minutes
- **Cross-cutting concern detection** — the integration spec pass caught bugs that neither the backend nor frontend spec had covered
- **Consistent naming** — AI maintained the same field names (`gameId`, `eventType`, `playerId`) across all layers without drift

### What didn't work / how we fixed it

| Problem | What AI got wrong | Fix |
|---------|------------------|-----|
| `SummaryStats` component | Generated with its own internal `useSummary` call — parent's `refresh()` never propagated | Manually converted to prop-driven component |
| Filter hook deps | Used object `filters` as `useEffect` dep — caused infinite re-fetch loop | Changed to primitive deps: `filters.gameId`, `filters.eventType` |
| Route conflict | AI didn't warn about `/summary` vs `/:id` ordering in first draft | Added explicit task + design note about route declaration order |
| Recharts types | Generated `<BarChart data={...}>` without proper TypeScript generics | Fixed types manually with `BarChart<SummaryData>` |

### Time saved estimate
> Without AI assistance, estimated time: **12–16 hours**  
> With AI assistance, actual time: **~4 hours**  
> **~70% time reduction** on boilerplate, spec writing, and documentation

## 4. Technical Decisions

### Key decisions

#### 1. Prop-driven components over self-fetching components
**Decision:** `SummaryStats`, `AnalyticsTable` receive data as props — they do not fetch internally.  
**Why:** Parent page controls when refreshes happen. After a POST, both table and summary refresh in one `handleSuccess()` call. Self-fetching components would require prop drilling a trigger signal anyway.

#### 2. Primitive values in `useEffect` dependency arrays
**Decision:** `useEffect(() => { ... }, [filters.gameId, filters.eventType])` instead of `[filters]`.  
**Why:** Object identity in React — a new `filters` object reference on every render would cause infinite re-fetch. Primitives are value-compared.

#### 3. Route declaration order in NestJS controller
**Decision:** `GET /analytics/summary` is declared before any route with a dynamic parameter.  
**Why:** NestJS resolves routes top-to-bottom. If `/:id` is declared first, `/summary` matches as `id = "summary"` and throws a 404 or wrong handler.

#### 4. Single `lib/api.ts` gateway
**Decision:** All API calls go through typed functions in `lib/api.ts`. No component calls `fetch()` directly.  
**Why:** Single place to change base URL, add auth headers, or swap to axios. Error normalisation (`ApiError`) happens once.

#### 5. In-memory store with `onModuleInit` seed
**Decision:** No database, no file persistence.  
**Why:** Meets requirements, zero infrastructure setup. Data resets on server restart — acceptable for a demo/test scenario.

### Trade-offs made to ship within time limit

| Trade-off | What we skipped | Impact |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| No pagination | Table shows all entries | Fine for seed data (~10–20 rows), would need paging at scale |
| No auth | API is open | Acceptable for internal demo |
| No optimistic UI | Table waits for POST response before updating | Slight UX lag on slow connections |
| No e2e tests | Only unit + manual verification | Covered by QA checklist instead |
| No persistent storage | Data lost on restart | Fine per requirements spec |

---

### What we'd improve with more time

1. **Pagination** — `GET /analytics?page=1&limit=20` with total pages in response
2. **Date range picker** — Replace text input with a proper calendar UI for `startDate`/`endDate`
3. **Optimistic updates** — Add entry appears instantly in table, rolls back on API error
4. **E2E tests** — Playwright tests for the full user journey (load → filter → add → verify)
5. **Persistent storage** — SQLite via Prisma — same zero-config spirit but survives restarts
6. **WebSocket** — Real-time push from backend when new entries are added (live dashboard)
7. **Auth** — JWT-based auth even at demo level
8. **Export** — CSV download of filtered analytics data

---

## 5. Results & Limitations

### ✅ What works well

- **All 3 API endpoints** functional with correct status codes (`200`, `201`, `400`)
- **Filtering** by `gameId` and `eventType` works independently and combined
- **Summary stats** — `totalEntries`, `totalGames`, `avgScore`, `avgDuration`, `eventTypeBreakdown` all accurate
- **Add entry form** — client-side validation, POST to API, dual refresh (table + summary) on success
- **Loading states** — skeleton cards for summary, loading indicator for table
- **Error states** — isolated per component, retry buttons restore data
- **Responsive layout** — works on mobile (375px) and desktop (1280px)
- **CORS** — no browser console errors during normal operation
- **Seed data** — 12 realistic entries with varied games/events make the dashboard useful on first load
- **Charts** — event type bar chart and score timeline render from live data

---

### ⚠️ What doesn't work or is incomplete

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Date range filtering | ⚠️ Partial | Backend supports `startDate`/`endDate` but FilterBar UI has no date picker — text input only |
| Pagination | ❌ Not implemented | All entries returned at once |
| Unit test coverage | ⚠️ Partial | Service methods tested; controller and hooks not covered |
| Form `metadata` field | ❌ Not exposed | `metadata` is accepted by API but no UI field in `AddEntryForm` |

---

### 🐛 Known bugs / edge cases

| Bug | Severity | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| `avgScore` returns `null` if no entries have a score | Low | Returns `null` instead of `0` or `"N/A"` — UI should handle gracefully |
| Filter reset doesn't clear URL params | Low | Cosmetic — no URL state management implemented |
| Recharts tooltip overlaps on mobile | Low | Small screen tooltip clips outside viewport on narrow devices |
| `onModuleInit` seed is not idempotent | Low | Restarting the server re-seeds, doubling entries if backed by persistent store in future |
